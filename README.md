# babynames
JAVA:

This program recieve user input of a type baby name & retuns a popularity number as well as a gender for the baby name input from user.

Required files: babyname.txt & nametypes.txt

Java imports:

Notes:

baby names need to be present within the baby name list before the program will work, so it is some what limited. This is a class project from my Java 220 class @ Green River Community College.
